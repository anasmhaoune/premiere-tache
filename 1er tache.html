    <p id="profile" >The 4-Hour Workweek was turned down by 26 out of 27
publishers.
After it was sold, the president of one potential marketing partner, a large bookseller, e-mailed me historical bestseller statistics to
make it clear—this wouldn’t be a mainstream success.
So I did all I knew how to do. I wrote it with two of my closest
friends in mind, speaking directly to them and their problems—
problems I long had—and I focused on the unusual options that had
worked for me around the world.
I certainly tried to set conditions for making a sleeper hit possible, but I knew it wasn’t likely. I hoped for the best and planned forthe worst.</p>

It was just past 5 p.m. in New York City, and I was exhausted. The
book had launched five days before, and I had just finished a series

Things have changed dramatically since April 2007. Banks are
failing, retirement and pension funds are evaporating, and jobs are
being lost at record rates. Readers and skeptics alike have asked:
Can the principles and techniques in the book really still work in an
economic recession or depression?</p>

   <p id="paiements" >In fact, questions I posed during pre-crash lectures, including
“How would your priorities and decisions change if you could never
retire?” are no longer hypothetical. Millions of people have seen
their savings portfolios fall 40% or more in value and are now looking for options C and D. Can they redistribute retirement throughout life to make it more affordable? Can they relocate a few months
per year to a place like Costa Rica or Thailand to multiply the
lifestyle output of their decreased savings? Sell their services to
